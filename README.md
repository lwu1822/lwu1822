Hi, I'm Lily. I’m a motivated and driven computer science student with a deep passion for software engineering and technology. I love building, debugging, and solving problems, and I’m always looking for new opportunities to learn and challenge myself.

My interests include full-stack development, backend/frontend engineering, and AI/ML. I’m also open to roles in cybersecurity, network engineering, and quality assurance.

Experiences:
- Software Engineering Intern at Northrop Grumman (2024 and 2025 summer)
- Software Engineering Intern (Part-time) at Nighthawk Coding Society (2023)
- National Champion of CyberPatriot XV Cisco Networking Challenge (Cybersecurity competition hosted by Air Force Association) (2023) 
- National Third Place of CyberPatriot XV Finals (2023)
